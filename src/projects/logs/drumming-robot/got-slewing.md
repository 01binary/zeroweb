The slewing drive I ordered this spring to rotate the upper body finally arrived:

It weighs around 50-60 lbs, but it's all concentrated in that enclosure so it feels super heavy. That's a good thing because it needs to balance out the entire upper body without having the robot tip over.

I have all the metal casting supplies ordered, and working on finishing the 3D printed arm models to start casting them next month:
