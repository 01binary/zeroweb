A full-scale replica of the exoskeleton frame worn in the movie Elysium (2013) by Max Da Costa.

## overview

Created in Autodesk Inventor using prop auction photographs and screen captures. Some of the parts were 3D-printed with Protolabs and then re-cast them out of Aluminum 356 in my metal foundry, and others were ordered from a CNC machine shop.

The pistons were machined on a metal lathe, and then the exosuit was assembled by using metal rod ends from McMaster Carr and screws from MSC Direct, Fastenall, and Lynx Heli.
