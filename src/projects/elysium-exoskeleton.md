A full-scale replica of the exoskeleton frame worn in the movie Elysium (2013) by Max Da Costa.

Created in Autodesk Inventor using prop auction photographs and screen captures. Many of the parts were with Protolabs and re-cast them out of Aluminum 356, others created using CNC. machined pistons on a metal lathe, and sewed a harness. The project was completed fall 2019, and now I'm working on tweaks to make it more comfortable to wear, such as re-casting some key parts out of hard rubber.
