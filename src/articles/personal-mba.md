## introduction

Josh Kaufman wrote "The Personal MBA" long before it was cool to flex your reading list on LinkedIn. Here are some major reasons why the world needs this book and why you should read it:

- Many business books are not practical, which makes them a poor fit for this "everybody's an entrepreneur" age
- The majority are written for graduates headed to management jobs straight out of school, not for the average person who wants to follow their dreams and start a business. A lot of what you learn in an MBA program focuses on getting the last ounce of performance out of a large organization which has already been built by someone else
- Business advice books are often used as an advertising device to position their authors as experts in their field (they can say "hey I wrote a book and spoke at conventions" to improve their own chances of moving up)
- In today's tech economy things are moving fast enough that you can't afford to sit on the sidelines and read a stack of books - your dream will be realized by someone else who stumbled their way through the same challenges and learned by doing
- Even with a full MBA education you will have to reconcile a great deal of theory with practice by repeatedly trying to apply these concepts and failing, so you might as well start with a troubleshooting guide

This book covers a huge amount of ground, so let's get started.
