Today I finally completed the setup of the Raspberri Pi as a WiFi HotSpot. Now I can connect to the robot's WiFi network and control/monitor the robot operating system running on it.

Since I had to come up with a name for the hot spot, I am officially calling this robot "Str1ker".

I used the solution in: http://raspberry-valley.azurewebsites.net/RaspAp-Wifi-Hotspot/ to run the hotspot.

Unlike the countless console commands I tried before, the setup was really fast, actually worked, and give me a GUI interface for configuring the hotspot.
