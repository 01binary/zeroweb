## motivation

Interactive 2D graphics and animation on the web can be useful for many reasons. They increase the user's engagement with the site and keep them using your application longer which leads to higher monetization. 

Interactive features on educational sites help students understand the material better and keep their attention longer. Online instruction manuals can walk users through the steps of a complicated process (like an automated COVID test) to realize significant savings on customer service calls.

Thanks to modern web development with React, SVG, and CSS, the cost of creating interactive animations is the lowest ever.
