## overview

This exoskeleton suit was created in [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview) using photographs of the movie props built by [Weta Workshop](https://wetaworkshopdesignstudio.artstation.com/). The original concept art was drawn by [Aaron Beck](http://skul4aface.blogspot.com/).

Some parts were 3D-printed with [Protolabs](https://www.protolabs.com/) and then re-cast out of Aluminum 356 in my metal foundry at [Ctrl^H hackerspace](https://pdxhackerspace.org/), others were machined by Protolabs CNC machining service out of Aluminum 6061.

The pistons were machined on a metal lathe, and then the exosuit was assembled by using [metal rod ends](https://www.mcmaster.com/rod-ends/ball-joint-rod-ends-10/shank-thread-size~m6/) from McMaster Carr.
