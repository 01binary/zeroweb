Today the Dynamixel Pro servo arrived - thanks Robotis!

I built ROS Melodic from source (there was no distribution for Raspbian on my PI4) but got stuck configuring it as a Wi-Fi access point so that I can connect to ROS master node running there. I'm sure that will be fixed early this week and I can proceed with hooking up servos. I also contacted someone I worked with before to make an arm prototype out of wood before ordering sheet metal parts or making investment casting molds.
