Switchback is a double-neck guitar with a built-in keyboard for playing [neurometal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ZwTvIdYJGJxl1kszP3a_z6O4DcHwvok). It can integrate with a sequencer to perform a software synth and display the waveform in onboard oscilloscope built into the handle.

## overview

- 6-string (bottom) modeled after [Strandberg Boden Metal 6](https://strandbergguitars.com/product/boden-metal-6-white-pearl/) with Fishman Fluence Modern 6 pickups
- 8-string (top) modeled after [Strandberg Boden Metal 8](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BDMT8BKP--strandberg-boden-metal-8-black-pearl) with Fishman Fluence Modern 8 pickups
- 9-key [Roli Seaboard Block keyboard](https://roli.com/products/seaboard) (bottom) with two extra dimensions of touch
- Built-in oscilloscope can display a waveform from a remote synth or sampler, similar to [Korg Minilogue](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MinilogueXD--korg-minilogue-xd-4-voice-analog-synthesizer)

## build

Switchback is being built by [Claas Guitars](https://claasguitars.com/) in Germany, a luthier that specializes in custom shop headless guitars.

The luthier had to make many adjustments to make the guitar playable, such as customizing pickup positions and increasing the space between the two necks.

The body has extra space to fit in electronics for the Seaboard, and both the built-in keyboard and oscilloscope will communicate with a computer running Ableton by using Bluetooth.
