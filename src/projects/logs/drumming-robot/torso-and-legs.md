Slew drive was picked, NEMA 34 DC motor picked. I started working on the legs while I am waiting for the gearbox STEP model to install in the assembly for a final "what's it going to look like" render.

Leg: option 2 (based on Pinterest art, but with my twist)

I blocked out the flat sheet metal parts for now, going get those dimensioned before I move onto making the leg 3D.
